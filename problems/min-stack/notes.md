# Min Stack

## Heuristics
1) Two stacks are needed. The `minStack` will be used to store the minimum
2) The key idea is to use Java's stack data structure (array or linked list implementation will not satisfy
the time complexity constraint).

## Optimal Complexity

**Time:** O(1) for each function <br>
**Space:** O(n)
