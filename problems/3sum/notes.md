# 3Sum

## Heuristics
1. Break the problem into two sub-problems, by utilizing the 2Sum problem approach. 
2. Sorting the array makes the problem significantly easier, in terms of determining 
which variables to increment and when. 
3. Think carefully about what duplicate values means, and where the logic to avoid
duplicates should be located.

## Optimal Complexity

**Time:** O(n<sup>2</sup>) <br>
**Space:** O(n) for Arrays.sort, O(m) for output list
